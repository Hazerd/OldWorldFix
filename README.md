# OldWorldFix
OldWorldFix is a tool designed to make porting old Minecraft custom worlds a piece of cake!

Minecraft custom worlds created for older versions of the game have many problems when updated to more modern versions. This tool aims to fix most - if not all of them.

Issues currently fixed:
* (1.8+) Chests disappear.
* (1.13+) Potions turn into water bottles.
* (1.11+) Custom potion spawners spawn nothing.
* (1.13+) Custom potion spawners cause chunk errors.
* More to come!

Issues planned to be fixed:
* (1.8+) Paintings pop off walls.
* (1.8+) Some doors disappear. (I'm not sure if this can be fixed automatically)
